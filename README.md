# 2021 Summer Gap Task AO2 - C Port

This is an experiment I am doing with my original project in an effort to try 
to teach myself C.

Original: <https://github.com/ewave99/2021-Summer-GapTask-AO2>

## Differences from the original Python version:

- No validation for the input of the species name
- Names are case-sensitive when checking whether they already exist

## To do

- Create a branch to experiment with using a linked-list implementation of the list of Species records
